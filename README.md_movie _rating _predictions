🎬 Movie Rating Predin using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project is part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, actors, duration, and votes.

Movie rating prediction is a regression problem where the model learns patterns from historical movie data and estimates ratings for new movies.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following features:

- Name – Movie name
- Year – Release year of the movie
- Duration – Length of movie (in minutes)
- Genre – Category of the movie
- Votes – Number of votes received
- Director – Director of the movie
- Actor 1 – Lead actor
- Actor 2 – Supporting actor
- Actor 3 – Supporting actor
- Rating – Target variable (movie rating)

---

⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

---

🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Handled missing values
- Converted categorical features into numerical format
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Selected input features and target variable
- Split dataset into training and testing sets

---

🎯 Features Used for Prediction

Input Features (X):

- Year
- Duration
- Genre
- Votes
- Director
- Actor 1
- Actor 2

🤖 Machine Learning Model Used

Linear Regression

Linear Regression is used because this is a regression problem where we predict continuous values (movie ratings).

Steps performed:

- Model training using training dataset
- Prediction using testing dataset
- Model evaluation using error metrics

---

📈 Results

The model was successfully trained and tested.

Example output:

Mean Squared Error: (example)

Mean Squared Error: 0.45

This shows the model can predict movie ratings with reasonable accuracy.
