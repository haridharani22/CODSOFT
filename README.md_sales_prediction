📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales using Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to build a regression model that estimates sales based on advertising expenditures across different platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

Sales prediction helps businesses make data-driven decisions by understanding how marketing investments impact revenue. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

📊 Dataset Used

The dataset used in this project contains advertising budget details and corresponding sales values.

Features:

TV – Advertising budget spent on TV

Radio – Advertising budget spent on Radio

Newspaper – Advertising budget spent on Newspaper

Sales – Product sales (Target Variable)


The dataset is structured in CSV format and used for regression analysis.

🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Checked for missing values

Selected relevant features

Separated input features (X) and target variable (y)

Split dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)


No major missing values were found, so minimal cleaning was required.

📈 Results

The Linear Regression model was successfully trained and tested.

Evaluation Metrics Used:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score


The model achieved a good R² score, indicating a strong relationship between advertising budget and sales.

Example Output:

Mean Squared Error: (example value)
R² Score: (example value close to 1 shows good performance)

This shows that the model can reasonably predict sales based on advertising expenditure.

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world business problems such as sales forecasting.

Using Linear Regression, we successfully:

Built a regression model

Trained and tested the model

Evaluated performance using metrics

Predicted future sales based on new input values


This project strengthens understanding of regression models, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques in data science.
